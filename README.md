# PixLab

The PixLab lab is the second lab of the year in AP Computer Science A (the first was Magpie, the chatbot lab).

You will be applying your knowledge of two dimensional arrays (along with previous concepts) to manipulate images, which are just 2D grids of colors (pixels).

We will also be covering binary (and other number bases), which are sometimes on the multiple choice section of the AP Exam. 

At the end of the lab we will have an exam covering 2D arrays, binary, and enhanced for loops.

## Info for Act 2

Download the ColorChoose.java file and run it. You should see a grid of colors and tabs at the top like in the image below.

Note: if using Replit, change the name of the class from `ColorChooser` to `Main`, then click Run at the top. It may also be helpful to resize the window that you can see everything.

## Important Info for Acts 3-9

If using an IDE on your computer such as BlueJ, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc., download the Github repo as a zip. The classes and images folders should be at the same level in the project folder OR the images can be copied into the same folder as the .java files. Don't forget to include the .gif files in the classes file.

On Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code, you may need to have the images in the project folder outside of your src files where the .java files are.

If using Repl.it:
* Go to my [PixLab project](https://repl.it/@codyjking/PixLab) and click the blue "Fork" button.
* When you edit a file, you can compile it by typing `javac <filename>` in the console and then hitting enter. For example, if you change the image in `PictureExplorer`, compile by typing `javac PictureExplorer.java`.
* To run, type `java <classname>` and then hit enter. For example, if you want to run `ColorChooser.java`, type `java ColorChooser` (don't include the .java). If you close the program and the orange arrow doesn't show up again, click inside the console and press `CTRL-C`.

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
